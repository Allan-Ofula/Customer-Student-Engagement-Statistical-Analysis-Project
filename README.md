3. Is there a significant difference in engagement between free and paid users?
4. Which regions showed the highest/lowest growth in engagement?
5. Do engagement patterns differ significantly across different learning topics?
6. What factors contributed to higher engagement, and how can they be optimized further?


## Data Understanding & Analysis
To evaluate customer engagement metrics, we analyzed a dataset containing anonymized user interactions from 365 Company. The dataset provides key insights into how students engaged with the platform before and after the introduction of new features in 2022.

## Data Sources & Description
The dataset used for this project comes from 365 Company and contains anonymized student engagement data from Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. It was structured to analyze the impact of new platform features introduced in 2022 on student activity.
- **Internal Learning Platform Logs** – Captured real-time student interactions with the platform.
- **User Engagement Metrics** – Tracked minutes watched, course completions, and retention rates.
- **Regional User Data** – Provided insights into geographic engagement trends.

## Visualizations:

These visualizations provide a clear picture of how student engagement evolved after the platform updates in 2022. The statistical tests and visual analysis confirm that regional differences exist, and some features may have been more effective in certain markets than others.

## Key Findings
- After conducting a detailed statistical and visual analysis of student engagement in 2022, we derived several critical insights:

1️⃣ **Engagement Increased Overall, but with Regional Variations**
- Total minutes watched in Q4 2022 increased compared to Q4 2021, suggesting that new platform features had a positive impact on student engagement. However, regional differences emerged—India showed significantly higher engagement compared to the US.

2️⃣ **Free-Plan vs. Paid Students: Impact on Engagement**
- Paid students watched more content on average than free-plan students.
- Engagement growth was higher among free-plan students, indicating that the new platform incentives (XP system, streaks, and rewards) were particularly effective for non-paying users.

3️⃣ **The US vs. India Engagement Comparison: Statistical Validation**
- Welch’s t-test confirmed that engagement in India was significantly higher than in the US (p-value < 0.0001).
- The distribution of minutes watched showed that the US had more low-engagement users, while India had a higher concentration of high-engagement students. This suggests potential cultural or structural differences in learning habits across regions.

4️⃣ **Feature Effectiveness/What Worked Best**
- The XP system, streak tracking, and leaderboard incentives played a key role in driving engagement, particularly for free users.
- The impact of in-app coins was less pronounced, indicating the need for further refinements.

 ## Recommendations
Based on our data-driven analysis of student engagement on the 365 platform, we propose the following key recommendations to further optimize engagement and retention:

1️⃣ **Increase Engagement in the US Market**
